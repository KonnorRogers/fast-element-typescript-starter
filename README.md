# Purpose

A reusable template for getting started with Microsoft's FAST Element
web component library.

## What's included?

- Typescript setup
- Web-dev-server
- Web-test-runner
- Initial structure
- Example counter component with tests.
- Changelog generation with `standard-changelog`
- Linting with `ts-standard`
- [Custom Elements manifest generation](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/analyzer/getting-started/)

## Getting started

Click the `clone from template` button on Github.

Then, in your new repo do the following:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Navigate to `localhost:8000` and find the magic of the counter
component.

## Moving forward

Check out the `package.json` for all possible scripts.

## But what about yarn?!

If you want yarn, then fork this and use yarn ðŸ¤·
